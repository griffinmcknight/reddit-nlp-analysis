Absolutely! Designing a robust feature set is crucial for effective anomaly detection in time-series data, especially when dealing with complex and multifaceted datasets like Reddit engagement metrics. Below, I outline additional features you can incorporate into your anomaly detection model, along with strategies to leverage user clusters and communities. This comprehensive approach will enhance the model’s ability to identify truly anomalous behavior and provide deeper insights into your data.

# Comprehensive Feature Set for Anomaly Detection

1. Basic Engagement Metrics

	•	Number of Posts and Comments:
	•	Daily/Hourly Counts: Track the number of posts and comments over various time intervals (hourly, daily, weekly, monthly).
	•	Moving Averages: Apply Simple Moving Averages (SMAs) and Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trends.
	•	Average Scores:
	•	Average Score per Post: Calculate the mean score of all posts within each time interval.
	•	Average Score per Comment: Similarly, compute the mean score of comments.
	•	Total Scores:
	•	Total Score per Time Interval: Sum of all post scores and sum of all comment scores within each interval.

2. Derived Engagement Metrics

	•	Engagement Rates:
	•	Comments per Post: Ratio of the number of comments to the number of posts.
	•	Upvotes/Downvotes Ratio: If available, ratio of upvotes to downvotes can indicate the positivity or negativity of engagement.
	•	User Activity Metrics:
	•	Active Users: Number of unique active users posting or commenting in each interval.
	•	New vs. Returning Users: Distinguish between new users and those returning to the platform, which can indicate growth or retention issues.
	•	Content Metrics:
	•	Content Length: Average length of posts and comments, which can influence engagement.
	•	Sentiment Scores: Analyze the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) of posts and comments to detect shifts in community mood.
	•	Topic Distribution: Identify dominant topics using NLP techniques (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to see if certain topics correlate with anomalies.

3. Temporal Features

	•	Time-Based Indicators:
	•	Day of the Week: Engagement patterns can vary by day (e.g., weekends vs. weekdays).
	•	Time of Day: Analyze peak hours of activity.
	•	Seasonality Factors: Account for seasonal trends or recurring events that might influence engagement.
	•	External Events:
	•	Holidays and Major Events: Incorporate external data such as holidays, elections, or significant news events that might impact Reddit activity.

4. Network and Community Features

	•	Cluster-Based Metrics:
	•	Intra-Cluster Interactions: Measure the number of interactions (posts, comments) within each user cluster.
	•	Inter-Cluster Interactions: Track interactions between different clusters, which can indicate cross-community engagement or conflicts.
	•	Reciprocal Behavior:
	•	Reciprocity Rate: The rate at which users within a cluster interact with each other, such as mutual replies or upvotes.
	•	Community Growth:
	•	Number of Clusters Over Time: Track how the number of active clusters evolves, indicating community fragmentation or consolidation.

5. Advanced Statistical and Mathematical Features

	•	Local Extrema:
	•	Local Minima and Maxima: Identify and quantify the number of local minima and maxima within a sliding window to detect significant peaks and troughs.
	•	Area Under Curve (AUC):
	•	AUC Metrics: Compute the area under the engagement curve between extrema to measure the magnitude of spikes or drops.
	•	Rate of Change:
	•	First Derivative (Velocity): Calculate the rate at which engagement metrics are increasing or decreasing.
	•	Second Derivative (Acceleration): Measure changes in the rate of change to identify sudden shifts in engagement trends.
	•	Autocorrelation Features:
	•	Lagged Features: Incorporate values from previous time steps (e.g., lag-1, lag-7) to capture temporal dependencies.
	•	Autocorrelation Coefficients: Measure the correlation of the time series with lagged versions of itself to understand periodicity.
	•	Volatility Metrics:
	•	Rolling Standard Deviation: Assess the variability of engagement metrics over different windows.

6. Behavioral and Interaction Features

	•	User Engagement Patterns:
	•	Average Time Between Posts: Indicates how frequently users are posting.
	•	Response Times: Time taken for users to respond to posts or comments.
	•	Influencer Activity:
	•	Top Contributors: Track engagement from top users or influencers within the community.

7. Incorporating Clusters and Communities

Given that you’ve identified clusters and communities of users with high reciprocal behavior, integrating this information can significantly enhance your anomaly detection capabilities. Here’s how to do it:

a. Cluster Interaction Features

	•	Within-Cluster Engagement:
	•	Number of Posts/Comments Within Cluster: Track engagement metrics specific to each cluster.
	•	Average Score Within Cluster: Monitor the average engagement within each cluster.
	•	Between-Cluster Engagement:
	•	Cross-Cluster Interactions: Measure interactions between different clusters, such as replies or mentions.

b. Community Health Metrics

	•	Reciprocity Rate:
	•	Definition: The frequency of reciprocal interactions (e.g., mutual replies) within a cluster.
	•	Implementation: Calculate the ratio of reciprocal interactions to total interactions.
	•	Cluster Growth Rate:
	•	Definition: The rate at which new members are joining a cluster.
	•	Implementation: Track the number of new users in each cluster over time.

c. Cluster-Specific Anomaly Indicators

	•	Engagement Surges within Clusters:
	•	Definition: Sudden increases in activity within a specific cluster.
	•	Implementation: Apply anomaly detection algorithms separately on each cluster’s engagement metrics.
	•	Cross-Cluster Conflict Indicators:
	•	Definition: Unusual spikes in negative interactions between clusters.

8. Incorporating All Features into the Dataset

Here’s how you can structure your dataset with the suggested features:
```
Date	Total_Posts	Total_Comments	Avg_Score_Post	Avg_Score_Comment	MA_7_Posts	MA_7_Comments	Std_7_Posts	Std_7_Comments	Sentiment_Score	Topic_Distribution	Active_Users	New_Users	Reciprocated_Interactions	Intra_Cluster_Engagement	Inter_Cluster_Engagement	Local_Maxima	Local_Minima	AUC_Spike	AUC_Drop	Velocity	Acceleration	Autocorrelation_1	Rolling_Std	…	Anomaly_Label
2024-01-01	100	500	10.5	2.3	95	480	5	15	0.2	[0.1,0.3,…]	200	50	150	80	70	1	0	5000	2000	5	0.1	0.8	12	…	0
2024-01-02	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…	…

9. Feature Selection and Engineering Strategies

Given the extensive list of potential features, it’s essential to apply feature selection techniques to identify the most impactful ones. Here’s how:

a. Correlation Analysis

	•	Objective: Identify features that are highly correlated with anomalies.
	•	Implementation: Use Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients to find relationships between features and the anomaly label.
```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming 'anomaly_label' is your target variable
correlation_matrix = daily_engagement.corr()
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, fmt=".2f", cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()
```
b. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

	•	Objective: Reduce dimensionality while retaining most variance.
	•	Implementation: Apply PCA to identify principal components that explain the majority of variance in the data.

```python
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA

pca = PCA(n_components=10)
principal_components = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)
```
c. Feature Importance from Models

	•	Objective: Determine which features contribute most to anomaly detection.
	•	Implementation: Use models like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting to extract feature importances.
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

clf = RandomForestClassifier()
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
importances = clf.feature_importances_
```
d. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)

	•	Objective: Iteratively remove least important features.
	•	Implementation: Use RFE with cross-validation to select the best subset of features.
```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import RFE
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier()
rfe = RFE(model, n_features_to_select=20)
fit = rfe.fit(X_train, y_train)
selected_features = X_train.columns[fit.support_]
```
10. Implementing the Enhanced Feature Set in Your Pipeline

Here’s how you can incorporate these features into your data processing and anomaly detection pipeline:

a. Data Aggregation and Feature Engineering
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime

def preprocess_data(posts, comments, user_clusters, selected_subreddits):
    # Convert timestamps
    posts['created_utc'] = pd.to_datetime(posts['created_utc'], unit='s')
    comments['created_utc'] = pd.to_datetime(comments['created_utc'], unit='s')
    
    # Filter by subreddits
    posts = posts[posts['subreddit'].isin(selected_subreddits)]
    comments = comments[comments['subreddit'].isin(selected_subreddits)]
    
    # Aggregate daily engagement
    daily_posts = posts.resample('D', on='created_utc').agg({
        'post_id': 'count',
        'score': ['sum', 'mean']
    }).rename(columns={'post_id': 'total_posts', 'sum': 'total_score_posts', 'mean': 'avg_score_post'})
    
    daily_comments = comments.resample('D', on='created_utc').agg({
        'comment_id': 'count',
        'score': ['sum', 'mean']
    }).rename(columns={'comment_id': 'total_comments', 'sum': 'total_score_comments', 'mean': 'avg_score_comment'})
    
    daily_engagement = daily_posts.join(daily_comments, how='outer').fillna(0)
    daily_engagement.reset_index(inplace=True)
    
    # Additional Features
    # Moving Averages
    daily_engagement['ma_7_posts'] = daily_engagement['total_posts'].rolling(window=7).mean()
    daily_engagement['ma_7_comments'] = daily_engagement['total_comments'].rolling(window=7).mean()
    
    # Rolling Standard Deviation
    daily_engagement['std_7_posts'] = daily_engagement['total_posts'].rolling(window=7).std()
    daily_engagement['std_7_comments'] = daily_engagement['total_comments'].rolling(window=7).std()
    
    # Sentiment Scores (Assuming you have sentiment analysis results)
    # daily_engagement['sentiment_score'] = ... 
    
    # Topic Distribution (Assuming topic modeling is applied)
    # daily_engagement['topic_distribution'] = ... 
    
    # Active Users
    daily_engagement['active_users'] = posts.resample('D', on='created_utc')['user_id'].nunique()
    
    # New Users
    # Define "new" as users who made their first post/comment on that day
    user_first_post = posts.groupby('user_id')['created_utc'].min().reset_index().rename(columns={'created_utc': 'first_post_date'})
    daily_engagement = daily_engagement.merge(user_first_post, left_on='created_utc', right_on='first_post_date', how='left')
    daily_engagement['new_users'] = daily_engagement['user_id'].notnull().astype(int)
    daily_engagement.drop('user_id', axis=1, inplace=True)
    daily_engagement.drop('first_post_date', axis=1, inplace=True)
    
    # Cluster Interaction Metrics
    # Assuming 'user_clusters' is a DataFrame mapping user_id to cluster_id
    # Compute intra-cluster and inter-cluster engagements
    # This requires joining posts and comments with user_clusters
    # Example:
    # posts = posts.merge(user_clusters, on='user_id', how='left')
    # Similarly for comments
    
    # Local Extrema and AUC Metrics
    # Identify local minima and maxima
    from scipy.signal import find_peaks
    
    peaks, _ = find_peaks(daily_engagement['total_posts'])
    troughs, _ = find_peaks(-daily_engagement['total_posts'])
    
    daily_engagement['is_peak'] = 0
    daily_engagement.loc[peaks, 'is_peak'] = 1
    daily_engagement.loc[troughs, 'is_peak'] = -1  # -1 for troughs
    
    # Area Under Curve between extrema
    # This can be complex; consider defining windows between peaks and troughs
    # and computing AUC within those windows
    
    # Additional features as needed
    
    return daily_engagement
```
b. Incorporating Cluster and Community Information

Assuming you have a user_clusters DataFrame that maps each user_id to a cluster_id, you can derive interaction metrics as follows:
```python
def calculate_cluster_interactions(posts, comments, user_clusters):
    # Merge clusters with posts and comments
    posts = posts.merge(user_clusters, on='user_id', how='left')
    comments = comments.merge(user_clusters, on='user_id', how='left')
    
    # Intra-Cluster Interactions
    intra_posts = posts.groupby(['created_utc', 'cluster_id']).agg({
        'post_id': 'count',
        'score': 'sum'
    }).rename(columns={'post_id': 'intra_cluster_posts', 'score': 'intra_cluster_score'}).reset_index()
    
    intra_comments = comments.groupby(['created_utc', 'cluster_id']).agg({
        'comment_id': 'count',
        'score': 'sum'
    }).rename(columns={'comment_id': 'intra_cluster_comments', 'score': 'intra_cluster_score_comments'}).reset_index()
    
    # Aggregate intra-cluster interactions
    intra = intra_posts.merge(intra_comments, on=['created_utc', 'cluster_id'], how='outer').fillna(0)
    
    # Inter-Cluster Interactions
    # Define interactions between clusters, such as comments replying to other clusters
    # This requires additional data linking comments to posts and their clusters
    
    # Example: Number of comments from one cluster to another
    # inter = ... (Requires post-cluster mapping)
    
    return intra
```
c. Integrating All Features into the Anomaly Detection Model

Once you’ve engineered all necessary features, integrate them into your anomaly detection pipeline:
```python
from src.anomaly_detection.preprocess import preprocess_data
from src.anomaly_detection.detect_anomalies import detect_anomalies_isolation_forest, detect_anomalies_autoencoder, detect_anomalies_z_score
from src.anomaly_detection.visualize import plot_anomalies

def anomaly_detection_pipeline(posts, comments, user_clusters, selected_subreddits):
    # Preprocess Data
    daily_engagement = preprocess_data(posts, comments, user_clusters, selected_subreddits)
    
    # Feature Selection (assuming selected_features is a list of relevant columns)
    selected_features = ['total_posts', 'total_comments', 'avg_score_post', 'avg_score_comment',
                        'ma_7_posts', 'ma_7_comments', 'std_7_posts', 'std_7_comments',
                        'active_users', 'new_users', 'is_peak', 'is_trough',
                        # Include cluster interaction features
                        # 'intra_cluster_posts', 'intra_cluster_comments', ...
                        ]
    
    X = daily_engagement[selected_features].fillna(0)
    
    # Choose Anomaly Detection Method
    method = 'iforest'  # or 'zscore', 'autoencoder'
    if method == 'zscore':
        # Apply Z-Score Method
        from src.anomaly_detection.detect_anomalies import detect_anomalies_z_score
        threshold = 2.0
        daily_engagement = detect_anomalies_z_score(daily_engagement, threshold=threshold)
    elif method == 'iforest':
        # Apply Isolation Forest
        daily_engagement = detect_anomalies_isolation_forest(daily_engagement, contamination=0.05)
    elif method == 'autoencoder':
        # Apply Autoencoder
        daily_engagement = detect_anomalies_autoencoder(daily_engagement, epochs=100, threshold_percentile=95)
    
    # Visualization
    plot_anomalies(daily_engagement, method=method)
    
    return daily_engagement
```
11. Integrating Advanced Features and Models

a. Utilizing PyOD for Comprehensive Anomaly Detection

PyOD offers a wide range of anomaly detection algorithms that can be seamlessly integrated into your pipeline. Here’s an example using multiple detectors:
```python
from pyod.models.knn import KNN
from pyod.models.ocsvm import OCSVM
from pyod.models.auto_encoder import AutoEncoder
from pyod.models.iforest import IForest
from pyod.utils.data import evaluate_print

def run_pyod_models(X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test):
    models = {
        'KNN': KNN(),
        'OCSVM': OCSVM(),
        'AutoEncoder': AutoEncoder(hidden_neurons=[32, 16, 8, 16, 32], epochs=20, batch_size=32, contamination=0.05),
        'IsolationForest': IForest(contamination=0.05)
    }
    
    for model_name, model in models.items():
        model.fit(X_train)
        y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
        # Evaluate the model
        evaluate_print(model_name, y_test, y_pred)
```
b. Implementing Prophet for Forecasting and Anomaly Detection

Facebook’s Prophet is excellent for handling seasonality and trend components in time-series data:
```python
from fbprophet import Prophet

def detect_anomalies_prophet(daily_engagement):
    # Prepare data for Prophet
    prophet_df = daily_engagement[['created_utc', 'score']].rename(columns={'created_utc': 'ds', 'score': 'y'})
    
    # Initialize Prophet model
    model = Prophet()
    model.fit(prophet_df)
    
    # Make future dataframe
    future = model.make_future_dataframe(periods=0)
    
    # Predict
    forecast = model.predict(future)
    
    # Calculate residuals
    forecast['residual'] = forecast['y'] - forecast['yhat']
    
    # Define anomaly threshold
    forecast['anomaly'] = forecast['residual'].abs() > 2 * forecast['yhat_std']
    
    # Merge anomalies back to original data
    daily_engagement = daily_engagement.merge(forecast[['ds', 'anomaly']], left_on='created_utc', right_on='ds', how='left')
    daily_engagement['anomaly_prophet'] = daily_engagement['anomaly'].astype(int)
    
    return daily_engagement
```
12. Visualizing Anomalies with Enhanced Context

To provide users with deeper insights, visualize anomalies in the context of other features:
```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go
import streamlit as st

def plot_enhanced_anomalies(daily_engagement, method='iforest'):
    fig = go.Figure()
    
    # Plot daily score
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=daily_engagement['created_utc'],
        y=daily_engagement['score'],
        mode='lines',
        name='Daily Score',
        line=dict(color='blue')
    ))
    
    # Highlight anomalies
    anomaly_col = f'anomaly_{method}'
    anomalies = daily_engagement[daily_engagement[anomaly_col] == 1]
    
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=anomalies['created_utc'],
        y=anomalies['score'],
        mode='markers',
        marker=dict(color='red', size=10, symbol='circle'),
        name='Anomalies'
    ))
    
    # Add Moving Averages
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=daily_engagement['created_utc'],
        y=daily_engagement['ma_7_posts'],
        mode='lines',
        name='7-Day MA Posts',
        line=dict(color='orange', dash='dash')
    ))
    
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=daily_engagement['created_utc'],
        y=daily_engagement['ma_7_comments'],
        mode='lines',
        name='7-Day MA Comments',
        line=dict(color='green', dash='dash')
    ))
    
    # Add vertical lines for events or clusters (if any)
    # Example:
    # for event_date in event_dates:
    #     fig.add_vline(x=event_date, line=dict(color='purple', dash='dot'), annotation_text="Event")
    
    fig.update_layout(
        title=f'Daily Engagement with Anomalies ({method.capitalize()})',
        xaxis_title='Date',
        yaxis_title='Engagement Score',
        hovermode='x unified',
        plot_bgcolor='white',
        template='plotly_white'
    )
    
    st.plotly_chart(fig, use_container_width=True)
```

# Conclusion

By thoughtfully expanding your feature set and leveraging both statistical and machine learning methods, you can significantly enhance your ability to detect and interpret anomalies in Reddit engagement data. Incorporating user clusters and community interactions adds valuable context, enabling more nuanced insights into what drives anomalous behavior. Remember to maintain a balance between complexity and interpretability to ensure that your anomaly detection system remains both powerful and user-friendly.

If you need further assistance with specific implementations, coding examples, or have additional questions, feel free to ask

Your approach to clustering and community detection in Reddit engagement analysis is both thoughtful and strategic. By maintaining time window and subreddit-dependent clustering while iterating over various windows and subreddits, you’re setting the foundation for a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of user interactions and community dynamics. Here’s a detailed breakdown of your proposed methodology, along with insights, potential enhancements, and best practices to ensure its effectiveness.

# Understanding the Proposed Approach

	1.	Time Window and Subreddit-Dependent Clustering:
	•	Objective: Capture the temporal and contextual nuances of user interactions within specific subreddits.
	•	Rationale: Reddit communities can exhibit distinct behaviors and engagement patterns that evolve over time. Segmenting by both time and subreddit allows for more granular analysis.
	2.	Iterating Over All Possible Windows and Subreddits:
	•	Objective: Generate a diverse set of clusters and communities by exploring different temporal slices and subreddit contexts.
	•	Rationale: This ensures that transient patterns or emerging communities aren’t overlooked, providing a comprehensive view of engagement dynamics.
	3.	Meta-Clustering (Clustering the Clusters):
	•	Objective: Reduce the overall number of clusters by identifying similarities among existing clusters.
	•	Rationale: Aggregating clusters can help in identifying overarching patterns, reducing complexity, and enhancing interpretability.
	4.	Effective Clustered Representation of Network Interactions:
	•	Objective: Develop a robust model that encapsulates user interactions across various dimensions (time, subreddit).
	•	Rationale: Such a representation can facilitate advanced analyses like predictive modeling, anomaly detection, and trend forecasting.

# Deep Dive into Each Component

1. Time Window and Subreddit-Dependent Clustering

Benefits:
	•	Contextual Relevance: Different subreddits cater to varied topics and user bases. Tailoring clusters to each subreddit ensures that the unique dynamics of each community are captured.
	•	Temporal Dynamics: Engagement patterns can fluctuate due to external events, seasonal trends, or internal subreddit activities. Time windows help in understanding these temporal shifts.

Considerations:
	•	Window Size Selection: The choice of window size (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly) can significantly impact the clustering results. It might be beneficial to experiment with multiple window sizes or implement a multi-scale approach.
	•	Overlap Between Windows: To capture gradual changes, consider overlapping windows (e.g., sliding windows) rather than discrete, non-overlapping ones.

Recommendations:
	•	Dynamic Windowing: Instead of fixed window sizes, explore dynamic windowing techniques that adapt based on the data’s volatility or density.
	•	Hierarchical Clustering: Implement hierarchical clustering to capture both short-term and long-term engagement patterns within each subreddit.

2. Iterating Over All Possible Windows and Subreddits

Benefits:

	•	Graph Embeddings:
	•	Approach: Represent clusters as nodes in a higher-level graph, with edges representing similarities or interactions, and apply graph-based clustering algorithms.

# Incorporating Extrema and Area Under Curve (AUC) Metrics

Identifying local minima and maxima and computing AUC metrics can provide valuable insights into the magnitude and significance of engagement fluctuations.

1. Local Extrema Detection

Benefits:
	•	Identifying Significant Events: Peaks and troughs can correspond to events like viral posts, bot activity, or coordinated campaigns.
	•	Trend Analysis: Understanding the frequency and magnitude of extrema helps in assessing the volatility of engagement.

Implementation:
	•	Using scipy.signal.find_peaks:
```python
from scipy.signal import find_peaks

# Detect peaks
peaks, _ = find_peaks(daily_engagement['total_posts'], distance=7)  # Adjust 'distance' as needed

# Detect troughs by inverting the signal
troughs, _ = find_peaks(-daily_engagement['total_posts'], distance=7)

# Annotate extrema
daily_engagement['is_peak'] = 0
daily_engagement.loc[peaks, 'is_peak'] = 1
daily_engagement.loc[troughs, 'is_peak'] = -1
```


2. Area Under Curve (AUC) Metrics

Benefits:
	•	Quantifying Engagement Surges/Drops: AUC provides a measure of the total engagement over a period, highlighting significant increases or decreases.
	•	Comparative Analysis: Enables comparison between different time periods or clusters based on their engagement volumes.

Implementation:
	•	Defining Windows Between Extrema:
```python
import numpy as np

# Combine peaks and troughs
extrema = sorted(peaks.tolist() + troughs.tolist())

# Calculate AUC between consecutive extrema
aucs = []
for i in range(len(extrema) - 1):
    window = daily_engagement.iloc[extrema[i]:extrema[i+1]+1]
    auc = np.trapz(window['total_posts'], x=window['created_utc'])
    aucs.append({'start': window['created_utc'].iloc[0],
                'end': window['created_utc'].iloc[-1],
                'auc': auc})

auc_df = pd.DataFrame(aucs)
```

	•	Integrating AUC into Features:

# Example: Assign AUC to each day based on the window it falls into
```python
daily_engagement['auc_spike'] = 0
daily_engagement['auc_drop'] = 0

for _, row in auc_df.iterrows():
    if row['auc'] > threshold_spike:
        daily_engagement.loc[(daily_engagement['created_utc'] >= row['start']) &
                            (daily_engagement['created_utc'] <= row['end']), 'auc_spike'] = row['auc']
    elif row['auc'] < threshold_drop:
        daily_engagement.loc[(daily_engagement['created_utc'] >= row['start']) &
                            (daily_engagement['created_utc'] <= row['end']), 'auc_drop'] = row['auc']
```


Considerations:
	•	Threshold Selection: Determine appropriate thresholds for defining what constitutes a significant AUC spike or drop. This can be based on statistical measures or domain knowledge.
	•	Window Size: Ensure that the windows between extrema are meaningful and not too short, which might lead to noisy AUC calculations.

    n = len(x)
    cumulative = np.cumsum(sorted_x)
    return (2 * np.sum(cumulative) / (n * np.sum(x))) - (n + 1) / n

daily_engagement['gini_post'] = daily_engagement['posts_per_user'].apply(gini_coefficient)
daily_engagement['gini_comment'] = daily_engagement['comments_per_user'].apply(gini_coefficient)
```


2. Engagement Velocity

	•	Definition: The rate at which engagement metrics are changing.
	•	Implementation: Compute the first derivative (day-over-day change) and second derivative (change in the rate of change).

posts['sentiment'] = posts['title'].apply(lambda x: sid.polarity_scores(x)['compound'])
daily_sentiment = posts.resample('D', on='created_utc')['sentiment'].mean().reset_index()
daily_engagement = daily_engagement.merge(daily_sentiment, on='created_utc', how='left').fillna(0)
```


4. Topic Modeling Features

	•	Definition: Identify dominant topics within posts to see if certain topics correlate with anomalies.
	•	Implementation: Apply topic modeling techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and assign topic distributions to each day.
```python

from sklearn.decomposition import LatentDirichletAllocation

# Vectorize text
vectorizer = CountVectorizer(max_df=0.95, min_df=2, stop_words='english')
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(posts['title'])

# Apply LDA
lda = LatentDirichletAllocation(n_components=10, random_state=42)
lda.fit(X)

# Assign dominant topic to each post
topic_assignments = lda.transform(X).argmax(axis=1)
posts['topic'] = topic_assignments

# Aggregate topic distribution daily
topic_distribution = posts.groupby('created_utc')['topic'].apply(lambda x: np.bincount(x, minlength=10) / len(x)).apply(lambda x: list(x))
daily_engagement = daily_engagement.merge(topic_distribution.reset_index(), on='created_utc', how='left').fillna(0)
```


5. Influencer Activity Metrics

	•	Definition: Track engagement from top contributors or influencers within the community.
	•	Implementation: Identify top users based on engagement (posts, comments, upvotes) and monitor their activity levels.
```python
top_users = posts['user_id'].value_counts().head(100).index.tolist()
posts['is_top_user'] = posts['user_id'].isin(top_users).astype(int)
daily_engagement['top_user_posts'] = posts[posts['is_top_user'] == 1].resample('D', on='created_utc')['post_id'].count().fillna(0).values
```


6. External Data Integration

	•	Definition: Incorporate external data sources that might influence Reddit engagement (e.g., news events, social media trends).
	•	Implementation: Merge external datasets based on timestamps to provide context for detected anomalies.

    daily_engagement['anomaly'] = 0
    for cluster_id in clusters['cluster_id'].unique():
        cluster_data = daily_engagement[daily_engagement['cluster_id'] == cluster_id]
        if len(cluster_data) < threshold_min_samples:
            continue  # Skip small clusters
        clf = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05)
        clf.fit(cluster_data[['feature1', 'feature2', ...]])
        anomalies = clf.predict(cluster_data[['feature1', 'feature2', ...]])
        daily_engagement.loc[cluster_data.index, 'anomaly'] = anomalies
    return daily_engagement
```
