# Swarm Detection Dashboard Outline

## Overview

The **Swarm Detection Dashboard** aims to identify patterns of potentially coordinated engagement, or "swarm" behaviors, within Reddit data. By analyzing user interactions, sentiment changes, and engagement trends, we can detect signs of coordinated campaigns that influence public sentiment or engagement. This dashboard is designed to visualize the activity and help uncover swarming behaviors across subreddits, users, and posts.

- **Burst of Engagement**: Sudden spikes in upvotes, comments, or shares within a short time frame that deviate from typical patterns.
- **Network Connections**: Accounts frequently interacting with each other (e.g., upvoting each other’s posts consistently).

## 1. Swarm Detection Timeline

### Daily Sentiment & Engagement Timeline
- **Purpose**: Show a timeline with daily average sentiment (color-coded) and engagement volume.
- **Details**:
  - The timeline will provide an initial view of activity spikes and sentiment shifts.
  - Engagement volume is represented on the Y-axis, while dates appear on the X-axis.

### Anomaly and Spike Detection Highlights
- **Purpose**: Automatically highlight days where engagement or sentiment spikes significantly above baseline activity.
- **Details**:
  - Detect anomalies such as extreme positive or negative sentiment, or engagement bursts that could indicate a coordinated swarm.
  - Visual cues (color changes or markers) will indicate periods of anomalous activity.

### Date Range Selector
- **Purpose**: Allow users to zoom in on periods with identified spikes for further inspection.
- **Details**:
  - Users can select a date range to focus on specific periods when swarms are detected.
  - The selected date range will adjust the visualizations accordingly.

## 2. Top N% Posts Analysis for Engagement and Overlaps

### Top Posts Table
- **Purpose**: List the top N% of posts with the highest engagement or sentiment scores.
- **Details**:
  - This table will allow users to filter posts by engagement (upvotes, comments) or sentiment score.
  - Users can customize the percentage of top posts displayed (e.g., Top 10%, Top 20%).

### User Overlap Analysis
- **Purpose**: Identify common commenters across top posts, highlighting users who appear across multiple posts.
- **Details**:
  - Emphasize users who engage frequently across multiple top posts.
  - Flag "Top Influencers" who contribute significantly to the sentiment or engagement of top posts.

### Interactive Network Visualization
- **Purpose**: Display a network graph with posts as nodes and user overlaps (edges) to visually represent connections between posts via shared commenters.
- **Details**:
  - Posts will be displayed as nodes, with edges representing shared commenters.
  - The graph can be filtered by sentiment (positive/negative) to explore sentiment-driven connections.

## 3. Engagement Speed and Trend Patterns

### Engagement Speed
- **Purpose**: Calculate and visualize the average response time for posts to identify patterns that suggest coordination.
- **Details**:
  - Calculate how quickly users respond to posts and visualize the speed of engagement over time.
  - Identify early bursts in engagement or rapid responses as potential signals of coordinated activity.

### Sentiment Over Time Per Post
- **Purpose**: Analyze sentiment progression within individual posts to detect shifts over time.
- **Details**:
  - Visualize sentiment changes within each post, especially when sentiment shifts sharply from positive to negative (or vice versa), which could signal coordinated narrative shifts.

### Sentiment Trends
- **Purpose**: Identify days where sentiment starts strongly positive/negative and shifts drastically.
- **Details**:
  - Highlight periods where significant sentiment changes are observed as engagement increases.

## 4. Frequent User Behavior Analysis

### Top Commenters & Frequent Engagers
- **Purpose**: List users who engage most frequently across posts.
- **Details**:
  - Track metrics like average sentiment, engagement frequency, and response time.
  - Emphasize users who might be driving coordinated engagement efforts.

### Behavior Timeline
- **Purpose**: Show a timeline of user engagement, highlighting rapid shifts in participation.
- **Details**:
  - Examine patterns where specific users engage quickly and frequently with high-impact posts.
  - Allow filtering by selected users to inspect individual behavior over time.

---

## 5. Bot and Coordinated Behavior Detection

### Bot-Like Patterns
- **Purpose**: Identify potential automated behavior or coordinated bot activity.
- **Details**:
  - Look for high-frequency, repetitive engagement or bursts of activity that could suggest automated behavior or manual coordination.
  
### Language Pattern Analysis
- **Purpose**: Analyze comment language for signs of repetition or coordination.
- **Details**:
  - Use basic NLP methods (e.g., keyword repetition, sentence similarity) to detect patterns in user comments, which could be indicative of coordinated messaging or automated scripts.

---

## 6. Sentiment and User Density Distribution

### Sentiment Distribution by User
- **Purpose**: Display the sentiment profile of top users.
- **Details**:
  - Help identify users who consistently engage with extreme sentiment (either highly positive or highly negative).

### Swarm Period Density Map
- **Purpose**: Visualize user density and engagement during identified swarm periods.
- **Details**:
  - Create a map showing user overlap and comment clustering during periods of heightened engagement or sentiment, highlighting potential swarming behavior.

---

## 7. User-Defined Thresholds and Parameters

### Custom Thresholds
- **Purpose**: Let users define thresholds for engagement, response time, and user overlap.
- **Details**:
  - Allow users to set their own parameters for what constitutes “high engagement” posts or rapid responses.
  - Enable customized detection for swarms based on user-defined criteria.

### Data Export and Download
- **Purpose**: Provide users with the ability to export data for further analysis.
- **Details**:
  - Allow users to download swarm data, visualizations, and tables for external analysis.

---

## 8. Insight Cards & Alerts

### Insight Cards
- **Purpose**: Provide brief insights when certain thresholds are met.
- **Details**:
  - Examples: “User overlap spike detected in top posts” or “Negative sentiment burst detected in frequent users.”
  
### Alerts for Coordinated Swarm Indicators
- **Purpose**: Flag posts or days where potential swarm behaviors are detected.
- **Details**:
  - Highlight posts or dates that meet the criteria for swarming, such as sudden increases in engagement or sentiment shifts.

## Conclusion

This dashboard provides a comprehensive toolkit for detecting and analyzing potential coordinated swarms within Reddit data. By combining sentiment analysis, engagement patterns, user overlap, and bot-like behavior detection, this tool can help identify and visualize swarming activity in real-time.
